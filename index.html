        <h2>What are Absentee Ballots?</h2>
        <p>Although many of us picture voting as being purely in-person, there are actually ways to make your voice heard even if you’re away from the state you’re registered in. Consider the students, military personnel, and other people away from home who want to cast their vote while out of town. The government satisfies this need through absentee ballots, through which registered voters out of state can mail their vote back home to be counted among the rest. College and university students benefit especially from this, as millions of voting-age young adults live far from home during election times. Voting participation is already low among the youth, so it’s important that students are aware of how they can make a difference in the country’s politics, even when they’re not home to go to the polls. Students can request to have an absentee ballot mailed to them through their state-specific registration website. Upon receiving it, students should fill it out and mail it back to the designated address. It should be noted that each state has different deadlines for absentee ballot requests and mail-ins. Check that out and more in our comprehensive list of state-by-state information.
